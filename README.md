<b>Apologies if this is not allowed, figured it'll help by:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Reducing the number of isssues being posted, so the forums can be less packed with unanswered threads</li>
    <li>More people will get more help; That which entaiks them telling their friends and GitHub getting more traffic</li>
  </ul><br />

<h2>For those who need help, this is what we help with: P.S- Please be aware of #1</h2> 
 <br / >
<ol>
  <li><b>Under <underline>NO</underline> circumstances does "help" mean creating your <b><underline>own</b></underline> website. If you need that done, it can privately be discussed.</li>
    <li>Stuck with a code after going over it multiple times and still cannot find an error? Post it to the team and we'll explain what it was and correct it!</li>
  <li>Stuck on a project or help excuting a code and it's not coming out the way it is supposed to? That's another speciality of ours!</li>
  <li>Know your languages, but not too fond of a language/(s), but need elp creating a code/modifying it? That's what we do!</li> <b>Help!</b>
</ol>
  <br />
The bottom line is simple: I am seeking members who wish to help with issues above and others that arise our way. We all know since the COVID situation and containment, a majority of us are stuck at home, which means online's traffic is most likely higher than it's <strong>everr, ever</strong> been, and will just increase. Just forming a group that wants to help - & if there become enough members who need help & apply to help longside me, then there will be a website created, as well.<br /> <br />

This took me quite sometime to write out, typing out the codes manually, etc - If this project is not allowed, please notify me and, if possible, close it instead of delete, because all I am trying to do is help.<br />
